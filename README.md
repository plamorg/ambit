# ambit

[![CICD](https://github.com/plamorg/ambit/actions/workflows/cicd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/plamorg/ambit/actions/workflows/cicd.yml)

Dotfile manager written in Rust.

`ambit` symbolically links files from a git repository to your system.
Files can be easily synced and are managed through a custom configuration file.

Features:

*   Custom configuration syntax tailored for dotfile management
*   Git integration
*   System-based alternative files
    *   By operating system and hostname

## Installation

Build the `ambit` binary from source:

    $ git clone https://github.com/plamorg/ambit.git
    $ cd ambit
    $ cargo install --path .

## Getting Started

Use `ambit --help` for a list of possible commands.

### Initializing

`ambit` syncs dotfiles from a directory located at `${HOME}/.config/ambit/repo` by default.
This can be overridden by setting the `AMBIT_REPO_PATH` environment variable.

To initialize an empty dotfile repository:

    $ ambit init

To initialize from an existing dotfile repository:

    $ ambit clone <ORIGIN>

### Syncing

After a dotfile repository has been initialized,
simply run `ambit sync` to symlink files from the repository directory to the home directory as set by your configuration file.
If no configuration file is found, `ambit sync` will attempt to find a configuration file in `AMBIT_REPO_PATH`.

Use `ambit clean` to remove all symlinks created through the current configuration file.

### Git integration

Git commands run through `ambit` will be executed with `${HOME}/.config/ambit/repo` as the git directory.

For example, to show the working tree status of the repository:

    $ ambit git status

### Environment variables

Optionally, 3 environment variables can be used to set custom paths.
If a variable is not set, it will take up its default value as outlined:

| Environment Variable | Description                            | Default                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| AMBIT_HOME_PATH      | Starting path of symlink destinations. | Home directory                       |
| AMBIT_CONFIG_PATH    | Path to configuration file.            | `${HOME}/.config/ambit/config.ambit` |
| AMBIT_REPO_PATH      | Path to dotfile repository directory.  | `${HOME}/.config/ambit/repo`         |

## Configuration

The purpose of the configuration file is to set the paths of the symlinks.
A symlink is defined with two parts: an existing file relative to `AMBIT_REPO_PATH`, and its destination relative to the system's home directory.

### Configuration syntax examples

#### Basic match

Symlink `${HOME}/host.txt` to `${AMBIT_REPO_PATH}/a/repo.txt`:

    a/repo.txt => host.txt;

#### Implicit match

If no `=>` operator is provided, it is assumed that the path given is both the `HOME` and `REPO` path.

Symlink `${HOME}/.config/ambit/config.ambit` to `${AMBIT_REPO_PATH}/.config/ambit/config.ambit`:

    .config/ambit/config.ambit;

#### Variant expressions

Variant expressions, denoted with brackets (`[]`), are a shorthand way to set multiple paths.

For instance, the variant expression `[a, b, c]` would expand out to `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Instead of manually writing out the paths, a variant expression can be used:

*   `${HOME}/.config/bat/bat.conf` to `${AMBIT_REPO_PATH}/.config/bat/bat.conf`
*   `${HOME}/.config/nvim/init.vim` to `${AMBIT_REPO_PATH}/.config/nvim/init.vim`
*   `${HOME}/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` to `${AMBIT_REPO_PATH}/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`
*   `${HOME}/.config/kitty/theme.conf` to `${AMBIT_REPO_PATH}/.config/kitty/theme.conf`

<!---->

    .config/[
        bat/bat.conf,
        nvim/init.vim,
        kitty/[kitty.conf, theme.conf]
    ];

#### Match expressions

Match expressions, denoted with braces (`{}`), allow to conditionally sync files based on a system's operating system and host.

The possible values of OS are:

*   linux
*   macos
*   ios
*   freebsd
*   dragonfly
*   netbsd
*   openbsd
*   solaris
*   android
*   windows

Conditionally symlink by os and host:

    {os(linux): .Xresources};

    {host(plamorg): .zshrc};

`default` can be used to specify a value if none of the other cases match correctly:

    {
        os(linux): .emacs,
        os(macos): .config/nvim/init.vim,
        default: .vimrc
    };

Combining conditionals allow to specify alternative files based on both os and host.
The following example would symbolically link `.config/bspwm/bspwmrc.bar` if the os was `linux` **and** the hostname was `bar`:

    .config/bspwm/{os(linux):
        {
            host(foo): bspwmrc.foo,
            host(bar): bspwmrc.bar,
            default: bspwmrc,
        }
    } => .config/bspwm/bspwmrc;

Match expressions can also be used to exclude. For the following example, the entry would not be considered if the hostname was `eclipse`:

    .config/nvim/{
        host(hexagon): init
        host(rpi): light
    }.nvim;

#### Escape special characters

Paths that contain reserved characters can be escaped with a backslash (`\`).
The following example represents a file in directory named `badly named[dir/}` called `config`:

    badly\ named\[dir\/\}/config;

## Development

The CI currently assures that `fmt`, `clippy` and `test` pass successfully.

Building:

    $ cargo build

Testing:

    $ cargo test

Formatting:

    $ cargo fmt

Linting:

    $ cargo check
    $ cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
